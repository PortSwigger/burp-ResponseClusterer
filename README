This plugin clusters all response bodies by similarity and shows a summary, one request/response per cluster. Adjust similarity in the options if you get too few or too many entries in the "One member of each cluster tab. The plugin will allow a tester to get an overview of the tested website's responses from all tools (scanner, proxy, etc.). As similarity comparison can use a lot of ressources, only small, in-scope responses that have interesting response codes, file extensions and mime types are processed.
