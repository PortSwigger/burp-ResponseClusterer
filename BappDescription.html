<p>This extension clusters similar respones together, and shows a summary with 
one request/response per cluster. This allows the tester to get an overview of 
the tested website's responses from all Burp Suite tools.</p>
<p>Options for determining similarity can be configured, in case too few or too 
many clusters are generated. Because the similarity comparison can consume a lot 
of ressources, only small, in-scope responses that have interesting response 
codes, file extensions and MIME types are processed.</p>
